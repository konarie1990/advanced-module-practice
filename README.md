# Let's practice modules

## Setup

- npm install
- npm start

* If you are on a windows machine, remove the single quotes from package.json in "start": "nodemon --exec 'babel-node src/index'"

- What shows up in the terminal?

## Do

- You should see the text `Cannot find module './modules/multiply'`
  Why? What's this telling us? Essentially, we haven't configured everything properly.
  Let's find the source of the problem.

- Look in your terminal, a few lines below the `Error:`
  What we are looking at is called a Stack Trace and what we are looking for the source of the error.
  You'll notice that the first couple lines below the error reference `internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:581:15`.
  This shows us the file and line number where the error occured. But.. that doesn't look like our file. It doesn't
  appear anywhere in our project. That's ok, it's a third party file. So let's keep looking for one of our files.
  `/advanced-module-practice/src/index.js:3:1`. If you go to that file and line number (3) you will see that it
  tries to import a file/module that doesn't exist! That's the problem!

- Add file and implement code for multiply module

- What's in the terminal now?

- Implement code for subtractNumbers module
  Create a file called subtractNumbers in the module folder. You should know where to look
  for this already but if you didn't.. it's in the first line of the `Error` message.
  Figure out what to call the function

- What's in the terminal now?
  Are you seeing a pattern?? Hopefully.. but it's a different error message now. You're on your own, you know
  how to find these errors now.

- The divide module is next.. let's tackle it!

- Let's finish the rest of the modules

  - Implement code for addOne in the addNumbers module
  - Import and use addOne in index.js
  - Implement the rest of the code for subtractNumbers module

- Run yarn start

* Make sure there are no errors
